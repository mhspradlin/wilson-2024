// TODO: Different structure
// Three parts
// - Story involving a person about topic
// - Crunchy mathy part, perhaps hands-on exercise
// - Read a thing and discuss in groups then as a class

#pagebreak()

= The Class
- Mix of lectures, reading, and discussions
- Break halfway through class
- Raise hand to ask questions at any time
- Be respectful and inclusive

#pagebreak()

= Background

Going around the room:
- What is your name?
- What school do you go to?
- What grade are you going in to?
- What are you most hoping to learn this week?

#pagebreak()

= Overview

/ Day 1: The Landscape, Fraud Detection
/ Day 2: Social Media Algorithms
/ Day 3: Chatbots
/ Day 4: Deepfakes
/ Day 5: The AI Control Problem

= The AI Landscape

/ Intelligence: The ability to perceive or infer information.
/ Artificial Intelligence (AI): Intelligence exhibited by machines.

The above definition is very broad. Most people mean a computer system that can make decisions that change depending on the circumstances.

== Definitions
- *Narrow AI* --- AI applied to solve a specific problem
- *General AI* (AGI) --- AI that can accomplish any intellectual task humans or animals can perform
- *Superintelligence* --- Intelligence that exceeds humans
- *Machine Learning* (ML) --- Computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience
- *Deep Learning* --- Subset of ML based on neural networks and representation learning

#figure(image("figures/AI_hierarchy.svg"))

- *Data Science* --- Using statistics and algorithms to extract knowledge from data
- *Traditional Programming* --- Encoding a set of rules for a machine to execute; typically contrasted with ML
- *Model* --- An abstract conceptual representation of the workings of a system of objects in the real worls
- *Training* --- Executing a Machine Learning algorithm on data to create a model

#pagebreak()

AI typically works together with data science:

== History

The idea of intelligent artificial beings has been around for a long time.

- AI assumes that the process of human thought can be mechanized
- Formal reasoning developed with a long history:
  - Aristotle --- Logic
  - al-Khwārizmī --- Algebra and algorithms
  - Gödel --- Logic, incompleteness proof
  - Many, many, more all over the world

#pagebreak()

- 1930s --- Cybernetics, early neural networks
  - Feedback loops, information theory, Turing machine
- 1950 --- Turing Test
- 1950s --- Checkers program
- 1956 --- AI founded as an academic discipline (Dartmouth Workshop)
- 1956-1974 --- Symbolic AI, rapid progrss and optimism
- 1974-1980 --- First AI winter
- 1980-1987 --- Expert systems boom, AI bubble
- 1987-1993 --- Second AI winter
- 1993-2011 --- AI behind the scenes
- 2011-Today --- Big data, deep learning, AGI

*AI Effect* --- as soon as AI successfully solves a problem, the problem is no longer considered by the public to be a part of AI. This phenomenon has occurred in relation to every AI application produced, so far, throughout the history of development of AI.

== Group Exercies

Split into groups and discuss:
- What are three examples of AI you have encountered in your life?
- How can AI be used as a useful tool?
- Are there any risks associated with AI?
We will then have a class discussion.
