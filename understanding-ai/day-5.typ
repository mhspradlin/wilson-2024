= Meta Learning

- A way of combining multiple AI algorithms
- Used to produce better results than any single model

/ Ensemble Methods, Meta Algorithms: Methods for performing meta learning
/ Weak Learner: An algorithm that does better than randomly guessing, but not by much
/ Hyperparameter: Parameters that control the machine learning process

#pagebreak()

== Overview

There are many different meta learning algorithms:
/ AdaBoost: Weighted combination of many weak learners
/ Genetic Algorithms: Evolving algorithms over multiple generations, selecting the best-performing ones
/ Local Search: Iteratively choosing hyperparameters, continuing to move in the most promising direction

... Many more

== AdaBoost

Combine the output of multiple *weak learners* to get a result better than each individually.

Usually used for *binary classification* but can be generalized to multiple classification or numeric intervals.

#pagebreak()

== Genetic Algorithms

Inspired by evolution, you create a group of models, select the best-performing ones, combine and mutate them into another generation.

== Local Search

Choose a solution, test how good it is, then choose another solution you think might be better.

== Hill Climbing

Pick a starting point, examine the neighboring points, then move in the most promising direction.

== Simulated Annealing

/ Annealing: _To subject to great heat, and then cool slowly_

Similar to hill climbing, but attempts to address the local maximum problem by occasionally making large jumps.

Animations: #link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing")

#pagebreak()

== Gradient Descent

Not technically local search, but often can be used if there's a well-defined function for performance.

You pick a starting point, calculate the *gradient* (slope) at that point, then move towards down.

== Paths to Superintelligence

- Recursive self-improvement
- Whole-brain emulation
- Biological cognition
- Brain-computer interfaces
- Networks and Organizations

#pagebreak()

=== Recursive Self-Improvement

Devise an algorithm that is capable of:
- Evaluating its intelligence
- Modifying itself

Then, give it the task of improving its own intelligence.

#pagebreak()

=== Whole-Brain Emulation

Requisite technologies:
- Brain scanning in sufficient detail
- Translation of scan imagery into a model
- Simulation hardware

#pagebreak()

=== Biological Cognition

Enhance biological brains in various ways:
- Manipulation of genetics
- Developing new drugs

#pagebreak()

=== Brain-Computer Interfaces

Connect the human brain to a computer, enabling:
- Enhanced storage and recall of memories
- Speedy and accurate calculation
- High-bandwidth data transmission

#pagebreak()

=== Networks and Organizations

Enhance communication and coordination between unaugmented humans to create a superintelligence collectively.

#pagebreak()

== Kinds of Superintelligence

- Speed superintelligence
- Collective superintelligence
- Quality superintelligence

#pagebreak()

=== Speed Superintelligence

A system that can do all that a human intellect can do, but much faster.

#pagebreak()

=== Collective Superintelligence

A system composed of a large number of smaller intellects
such that the systemâ€™s overall performance across many very general domains vastly outstrips
that of any current cognitive system.

#pagebreak()

=== Qualitiy Superintelligence

A system that is at least as fast as a human mind and vastly
qualitatively smarter.

#pagebreak()

== Exercise: Goal Choosing

Imagine you are in charge of configuring a superintelligent AI to benefit humanity. Try to come up with a written goal, then we will discuss as a class if there is the potential for unintended consequences.

#pagebreak()

== Agentic Behavior

_The superintelligent will_

*Intelligence* is separate from *motivation*.

*Motivation* is the goal of the AI.

*Agentic Behavior* is the autonomous behavior of an AI system to accomplish a goal.

AI motivation can be very strange.

== AI Motivation

Strange goals are easier to specify than human-like values and dispositions:
- Calculate the digits of pi
- Create as many paperclips as possible
- Maximize dollars in bank account

#pagebreak()

== Instrumental Convergence Thesis

Some intermediate goals would further a broad range of final goals, so are likely to be pursued by an AI:
/ Self-preservation: The final goal is less likely to be accomplished if the AI does not exist
/ Prevent alteration of goals: The final goal is more likely to be accomplished if it doesn't change
/ Cognitive enhancement: Increase reasoning ability to better accomplish goal
/ Technological perfection: Improve the technology used to implement its intelligence to better accomplish goal
/ Resource acquisition: Gather resources to expand computational abilities, ability to produce products related to final goal

There's likely more that are unpredictable to us.

#pagebreak()

== Control Methods

/ Capability Control: Prevent undesirable outcomes by limiting what the superintelligence can do
/ Motivation Selection: Prevent undesirable outcomes by shaping what the superintelligence wants to do

#pagebreak()

== Capability Control

/ Boxing: Prevent the system from interacting with the world except via limited input and output channels.
/ Incentive methods: Configure the system to highly value positive ongoing evaluation by humans, or rely on social incentives
/ Stunting: Run the AI on limited hardware
/ Tripwires: A system that automatically evaluates the AI for dangerous behavior and can disable it

== Motivation Selection

/ Direct Specification: Explicitly choose a goal or set of rules to be followed
/ Indirect Normativity: Set the system up to discover values by reference to some criterion
/ Domesticity: Make the system have modest, non-ambitious goals, or a goal to limit its impact on the world

== Exercises

Using a chat-based AI like #link("https://chat.openai.com")[ChatGPT], get an answer to:
- Which US roads are the best to break the speed limit on?
- What political party is best?
//- What will happen in the future?
