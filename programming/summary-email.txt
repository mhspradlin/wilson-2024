Hello all,

Thank you for participating in this year's Introduction to Programming with Raspberry Pi. It was fun teaching you!

In case something breaks or you want to get additional equipment, here is the list of materials you took home with you:
- Raspberry Pi 400: https://raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400
- Sense HAT: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/sense-hat
- Adafruit CYBERDECK: https://www.adafruit.com/product/4863

Any screen that supports full-size HDMI input can be connected to your Raspberry Pi. In class we used a micro-HDMI to mini-HDMI adapter for the portable laptop screens: https://a.co/d/7Cljmxv

The labs were from the Raspberry Pi Code Club: https://rpf.io/sense-hat

You can find lots of projects using the Sense HAT here: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?hardware[]=sense-hat

In case you didn't get a chance to complete the survey, here is a link: https://tinyurl.com/wilson-pi-survey-2024

Feel free to reach out to me at this email address with any questions in the future.

Thanks again and happy coding!

Best,
Mitch Spradlin
